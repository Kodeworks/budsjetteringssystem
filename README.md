# Liquidator [Frontend]

This is the frontend for liquidator.

To run this (with hot-reload), simply run the command

```bash
yarn start
```

If you wish to use storybook (to see the components in isolation), first install it:

```bash
npx -p @storybook/cli
```

And then run it by entering

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Other than that, it's just a create-react-app, so the normal `yarn build` etc. works!

Happy hacking! :tada:
